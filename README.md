# Pong Game

## Introduction.
Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity.The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972.

Pong was originally meant only as a training exercise for a new gaming developer at Atari, Allan Alcorn, and wasnâ€™t intended to be released as a consumer product.Initially, during the developmental stages, Alcorn found it quite boring, so decided to spruce it up a bit by making the ball bounce off the paddle at different angles, depending on what segment of the paddle was hit. He also had the ball progressively move at a faster rate after each successful return. By a happy accident of a defective circuit, the game also featured a space at the top of the screen which was unreachable by the paddles and which Alcorn felt made the game more fun, as skilled players could try to aim for that spot.

Over the years, Pong game has gained popularity and has become one of the most common game around and many developers has release differnt versions of the game.
